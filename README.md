# Mini_Calculator ðŸ§®
This my first mini-project in PythonðŸŽ‰
## In order to use my calculator you must:
- Install Python IDE (I recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/ru-ru/pycharm/download/) or [IDLE Python](https://www.python.org/downloads))
- Install Kivy librery
    + To install this librery write: 
    
    ```
    pip install kivy
    ```
 - Clone this [git-repository](https://github.com/Abdusharif0095/Mini_Calculator) with command below:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Abdusharif0095/Mini_Calculator
   ```
